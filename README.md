# DC-DC-Converter
# A dc-dc converter is an electronic deice which converters fixed dc voltage into a variable dc voltage. It is possible to either step-up or step-down the input dc voltage. A step-up (boost) converter is capable of rising the output voltage higher than the input voltgae. A step-down (buck) converter is able to lower the input voltage at the output.
