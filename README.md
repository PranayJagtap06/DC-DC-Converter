# DC-DC-Converter
# A dc-dc converter is an electronic deice which converters fixed dc voltage into a variable dc voltage. It is possible to either step-up or step-down the input dc voltage. A step-up (boost) converter is capable of rising the output voltage higher than the input voltgae. A step-down (buck) converter is able to lower the input voltage at the output. 
# converter_model.py: The converter_model.py is a python script.
# converter_model.exe: Its is a .exe file generated from the converter_model.py script. When runned the model takes some input parameters for the required by the converter and returns the value of inductor and capacitor ratings. And also mentions the type of converter i.e. either buck or boost converter.
